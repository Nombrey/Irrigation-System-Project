# Irrigation-System-Project
Irrigation system running on a Raspberry Pico and integrated into HomeAssistant through ESPHome

Contents:
- Full .yaml-file/code installed on the Raspberry Pico through ESPHome
- Code snipped from Automations.yaml in Home Assistant --> used to have an easy accessible and changable time trigger
- Screenshot of Balcony Dashboard which contains all relevant controls and sensor data regarding the irrigation system
- Video of working project --> manually triggering the pump relay

Remarks:
- The fill level sensor is not working in the final setup --> long cable to balcony caused a slight voltage drop --> sensor not properly reading anymore --> adjustable powersupply to compensate for that is planned but not yet installed
